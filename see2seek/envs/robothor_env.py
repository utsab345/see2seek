"""
Wraps AI2-THOR's Controller into a standard gym.Env interface with:
    - Discrete action space (MoveAhead, RotateLeft, RotateRight, Stop)
    - Geodesic-distance-based dense reward shaping
    - Automatic episode reset with goal image embedding loading

Episode structure:
    Each episode has:
        - A start position / rotation for the agent
        - A goal image embedding(pre-cached)
        - Success if the agent calls Stop within `success_distance` of goal

Reward structure:
    r_t = Δ(geodesic_distance) * scale + slack_reward
    r_T = success_reward  (if Stop is called and agent is at goal)
    r_T = 0               (if Stop is called but agent is not at goal)

    Geodesic-distance delta reward encourages movement toward the goal
    rather than rewarding visual similarity (which is encoded separately
    in the observation embedding).

Usage:
    env = RoboTHOREnv(cfg)
    obs_dict = env.reset()
    obs_dict, reward, done, info = env.step(action_int)
    env.close()

Resilience note (bad-spawn episodes):
    A small fraction of pre-generated RoboTHOR episodes have starting
    poses (position/rotation) that collide with static objects in the
    scene (e.g. a BaseballBat, a wall panel, etc.). AI2-THOR's
    TeleportFull will refuse these placements and return
    lastActionSuccess=False. reset() retries with the next episode (up
    to `_max_reset_retries` times) instead of crashing, and only raises
    once retries are exhausted — which would indicate a systemic
    problem, not a single bad episode.

Resilience note (Unity/controller crash mid-episode — added):
    The AI2-THOR "controller" is really a thin RPC client talking to a
    separate Unity subprocess over a FIFO pipe. If that Unity process
    dies (commonly from GPU/VRAM pressure on smaller cards, but also
    just occasional engine instability over long runs), the *next*
    write to the pipe raises a low-level BrokenPipeError/OSError deep
    inside ai2thor's fifo_server — not a clean AI2-THOR exception.
    Previously this propagated all the way up through step(), through
    the worker process, and killed the whole training run.

    step() now wraps the underlying controller calls and, on detecting
    a dead pipe/controller, tears down and restarts the Controller
    (_restart_controller) and starts a fresh episode via reset(),
    rather than letting the exception kill the worker. The returned
    transition is marked done=True with reward 0.0 and
    info["controller_crashed"]=True so the trainer's rollout/GAE logic
    treats it as a normal episode boundary (bootstrapping is not
    affected by a mid-episode crash-restart).
